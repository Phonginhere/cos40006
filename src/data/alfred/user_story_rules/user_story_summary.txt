ALFRED USER STORY DEFINITIONS AND STRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────

This document outlines the structure and definition of user stories used within the ALFRED system requirement analysis. These stories are created to capture the needs, behaviors, and constraints of real or representative users, and are designed to link personas to system functionalities across the six ALFRED requirement pillars:

  1. Pillar 1 – User-Driven Interaction Assistant
  2. Pillar 2 – Personalized Social Inclusion
  3. Pillar 3 – Effective & Personalized Care
  4. Pillar 4 – Physical & Cognitive Impairments Prevention
  5. General Requirements (Cross-cutting usability, privacy, personalization)
  6. Core Requirements (Developer-facing technical stories)

Each user story represents a **single, coherent expectation or need** from a persona's perspective. These stories are used to support system design, identify conflicts across personas, and prioritize features.

────────────────────────────────────────────

USER STORY STRUCTURE
─────────────────────
Each ALFRED user story contains the following elements:

• ID                  : A unique identifier for the user story (US-XXX).
• Type                : Pointing out whether the user story is functional and non-functional One ("Functional" or "Non-functional")
• Cluster             : The themetic group where the user story belongs to. This will be used to easily detect and handle the conflicts with other user stories
• Title               : A brief, descriptive label (30-40 characters).
• Persona             : The persona's id that the user story came from
• User Group          : Strictly, one of: "Older Adults", "Caregivers and Medical Staff", or "Developers and App Creators".
• Related Use Case    : ID of the use case that gave rise to the story (e.g., UC-004)
• Pillar              : Strictly, one of: "Developer Core", "General Requirements", "Pillar 1 - User-Driven Interaction Assistant", "Pillar 2 - Personalized Social Inclusion", "Pillar 3 - Effective & Personalized Care", or "Pillar 4 - Physical & Cognitive Impairments Prevention"
• Task                : The raw task that inspired this story (used internally for traceability)
• Priority Number     : A prioritization value from 1 (very high) to 5 (out of scope).
• Summary             : A 1–2 sentence description of the story, starting with the persona’s role & intent. Generally, it should not mention directly the persona's name. Strictly, the persona information should be dominant in the context of a user story rather than the system context, even if it contradicts some of the content in the system context.

────────────────────────────────────────────

USER STORY PRIORITY SCALE
──────────────────────────
The prioritization of user stories is based on project goals, user data, and expert input:

Priority | Definition
─────────|─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1     | Very high priority. Will be implemented.
   2     | High priority. Important for the ALFRED system; an implementation is planned.
   3     | Normal priority. Good additions for the ALFRED system; will be implemented if resources are available.
   4     | Low priority. Extensions to the system; may be included through synergies with other stories.
   5     | Out of the project scope. Will not be implemented.
