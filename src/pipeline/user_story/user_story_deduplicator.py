Below is a list of user stories written by the same persona. Each user story is represented by an ID and its summary.

Your job is to identify which user stories are redundant, overly similar, or express the same intent in slightly different ways. These may include reworded duplicates, near duplicates, or stories with the same goal phrased differently.

ONLY return the list of IDs of user stories that should be removed because they are duplicates or redundant. Return this as a valid JSON array of IDs.

USER STORIES:

üìå OUTPUT FORMAT - JSON array of IDs to remove (Below is just an example)):
[
  "US-017",
  "US-021",
  ...

Return ONLY the list likes the above example. Do not include any explanation, commentary, or formatting. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response.
