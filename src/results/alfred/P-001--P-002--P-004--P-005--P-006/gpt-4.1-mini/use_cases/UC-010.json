  "name": "Consent-Based Sensor Data Sharing",
  "description": "This use case addresses the negotiation and management of data sharing preferences between older adults and their caregivers, ensuring sensitive sensor data is shared securely and with explicit consent. It balances the informal caregiver’s need for detailed monitoring and the nurse’s clinical priorities with the older adult’s privacy expectations.",
  "scenario": "Elena Rivera, eager to explore her new ALFRED device, sat in her living room, ready to dive into the system’s features. She welcomed the assistant’s detailed explanations, asking ALFRED to walk her through how her wearable sensors share health data with her caregivers. Enthusiastic about transparency, Elena insisted on seeing every option and toggling settings to allow full data sharing, confident that more information meant better care. She even encouraged ALFRED to activate spontaneous social chats, hoping to reduce her occasional bouts of loneliness, despite the potential for unexpected interruptions.\n\nAt the same time, Sarah Thompson, Elena’s informal caregiver, was managing her busy schedule across multiple clients. She appreciated ALFRED’s clear notifications but preferred to review data sharing preferences carefully. When ALFRED prompted Sarah to review Elena’s consent settings, she found some of Elena’s choices too permissive, especially around sharing non-clinical data and social interactions. Sarah wanted to protect Elena’s privacy while maintaining close monitoring but felt conflicted because Elena insisted on unrestricted data flow. Sarah used ALFRED to manually adjust some permissions, restricting access to sensitive information like location and emotional state, hoping to strike a balance, but she anticipated pushback from Elena, who valued openness.\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Johnson, the registered nurse overseeing Elena’s clinical care, logged into ALFRED’s caregiver portal. Mike was frustrated by the extensive data sharing Elena allowed; to him, this was noisy and distracting. He preferred streamlined, clinically relevant information delivered discreetly during his shifts. ALFRED’s automatic notifications were muted according to Mike’s preferences, but he found himself stepping outside the system’s usual boundaries to access some health data without explicit consent, prioritizing clinical needs over privacy. Mike often felt that Elena’s informal caregiver and the patient herself complicated his efforts by blurring the lines between medical and social data. He wished ALFRED could enforce stricter clinical protocols, but he knew Elena’s enthusiastic consent and Sarah’s adjustments made this impossible.\n\nOne afternoon, Elena noticed Sarah had changed some of her data sharing preferences and confronted her via ALFRED’s messaging. Elena’s tone was firm but curious, wanting to understand why her consent was being overridden. Sarah patiently explained her concerns about privacy and data overload, emphasizing her responsibility to protect Elena’s dignity. Their conversation was occasionally interrupted by ALFRED’s spontaneous social chat invitations, which Elena found intrusive during the serious discussion. Mike, monitoring the exchange from afar, chose not to intervene, preferring to keep clinical matters separate.\n\nBy evening, the tension remained palpable. Elena cherished her autonomy and the freedom to share openly; Sarah sought to mediate privacy without alienating her client; Mike focused on clinical efficiency, often frustrated by the system’s compromises. The ALFRED system navigated this delicate triangle, facilitating negotiation but unable to fully reconcile their differing priorities. Each user’s experience was shaped by their unique values—Elena’s openness, Sarah’s protective caution, and Mike’s clinical rigor—highlighting the complex reality of consent-based sensor data sharing.",
