ALFRED Use-Case
───────────────

1. Purpose  
   • A use case is a mid-level requirements artefact that links high-level ALFRED pillars and concrete personas to the granular user stories that will
     be implemented.  
   • Each use case describes ONE coherent goal-directed interaction flow involving one or more personas and the ALFRED system.

2. Mandatory fields  
   id            Unique, stable identifier (e.g. “UC-012”).  
   useCaseType   High-level category: Onboarding / Daily Life Support / Health Monitoring / Social Enrichment / Recovery & Rehab / Trust & Privacy Negotiation / Developer Tools / Marketplace / etc. 
   name          2-6 word, Title-Case sub-type (e.g. “Night-Shift Vital Alerts”).  
   description   1-3 sentence abstract—what problem is solved and why it matters to those personas.  
   userGroups    List of user-group labels involved (Older Adults, Caregivers and Medical Staff, Developers and App Creators).  
   pillars       One or more ALFRED fundamental pillars (plus “General Requirements” or “Developer Core” if applicable).  
   personas      List of persona IDs that actively participate.  
   scenario      200-400 word lifelike narrative showing context → interaction → outcome.  Must mention EVERY persona by name or role.

3. Quality rules  
   • Must satisfy all “requiredUserGroups” and “requiredPillars” that the useCaseType dictates.  
   • Avoid duplicating names or scenarios that already exist in the project. (Unique name + fresh storyline.)  
   • Keep technology details believable: voice commands, sensors, marketplace apps, data-sharing consents, etc., exactly as ALFRED supports.  
   • Respect persona quirks, goals and pain-points when writing the scenario.  
   • Write prose — no bullet lists, no markdown, no code fences.

4. Typical length guidelines  
   name        ≤ 40 characters  
   description 25-50 words  
   scenario    200-400 words, 2-5 paragraphs

5. Output format for LLM steps  
   • Step 2a expects a JSON with “name” and “description”.  
   • Step 2b expects plain scenario text, nothing else.

Use cases act as the single source of truth for later stages: Persona → Use Case → User Stories → Conflict-checked User Stories → Acceptance Tests

Un-real examples of Use cases.

Note that, the following are just the just non-existent examples, which are used for references only, and do not confuse with the real inputs provided (personas, summaries, ...):

UC - Set Up with Care Organization
  • Type  : Onboarding / Setup
  • Description  : A home-care provider installs ALFRED on a pre-configured smartphone for an older adult and jointly configures data-sharing rules, hobbies and a basic health profile with medical staff.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff  
  • Personas: Otto the Older Person, Mike from the Medical Staff
  • Scenario: The Home Care organization is implementing ALFRED as part of its new innovation programme, offering better and more efficient services to its clients. As part of the programme, Otto the Older Person receives a smartphone from the organization, which comes with ALFRED pre-installed. The costs of ALFRED and the smartphone are covered by his health insurance package.\n\nMike from the Medical Staff brings Otto the smartphone and together they set up the user profile of Otto. Otto is somewhat insecure about security and wants to know exactly what ALFRED does with his personal data and if it shares information about himself only with his specific permission. After they have set up a plan on who can see which part of Otto’s data, Otto is happy to indicate his hobbies and interests and he lists his contacts, namely his friends and neighbours.\n\nOtto also wants to strengthen his social network and be able to share information on social events with other users, as he is feeling increasingly isolated. Together they set up a profile on ALFRED that allows Otto to connect with other ALFRED users so Otto can be notified about social, sporting and cultural events in his surroundings.\n\nDuring the setup process, there are also some questions regarding his health status as well as his medication. Otto is physically healthy and does not need much medical attention. But he is worried about needing more support as he gets older. Therefore Otto agrees to set up a basic health profile together with Mike on ALFRED to share some information on his heart rate and emotional status that later can be expanded. Apart from the setup, the only technical task that Otto has to take care of is to frequently charge the battery of the smartphone that ALFRED is running on. All other interaction with the system is done simply by voice.
  • Pillars: General Requirements, Pillar 1 (Interaction), Pillar 2 (Social Inclusion), Pillar 3 (Effective & Personalized Care)

UC - Personalizing ALFRED
  • Type  : Daily Life Support
  • Description  : In the first week of use, the older adult tailors agenda, reminders and privacy settings while ALFRED gradually learns contacts and locations.  
  • Groups: Older Adults  
  • Personas: Otto the Older Person
  • Scenario: The first few days Otto the Older Person is getting acquainted with all the services ALFRED has to offer. For Otto it is easy to start to use ALFRED as the solution introduces himself to Otto and shows the different functionalities that might be helpful for him. Otto is confident knowing that the device does not do any activities without his preliminary permission, as he has verified that this setting is on. This is important to him as he wants to keep control over the device. Through the initial training, Otto gets acquainted with the agenda options, where he can add new appointments by simply speaking to the device. ALFRED reminds Otto of his agenda entries on a daily basis. ALFRED suggests that he could share his agenda with Mike from the Medical Staff, but Otto refused this as he considers this kind of information private. ALFRED is up to date on Mike’s visits to Otto, so he gives him a short notice when Mike is coming so that Otto does not get impatient while waiting. Whenever ALFRED reminds Otto of an appointment, it suggests navigating him there. By inserting the information in the agenda, ALFRED also learns more about Otto and can relate his contact persons with the items in his agenda, as well as the locations to navigate him there. ALFRED reminds Otto every day to take his medicine. Sometimes Otto is confused and asks for a clarification. ALFRED then explains which medicine it refers to and what the box looks like. In case of any important health-related questions, Otto can easily consult Mike with ALFRED.
  • Pillars: General Requirements, Pillar 1, Pillar 3

UC - Personalized Social Inclusion
  • Type  : Social Enrichment
  • Description  : ALFRED proposes local social events, enabling the older adult to discover new activities, make friends and use video calls with family.  
  • Groups: Older Adults  
  • Personas: Otto the Older Person
  • Scenario: ALFRED suggests different activities to Otto the Older Person on a daily basis. Often Otto does not feel like it, but sometimes his interest is caught. Last week, ALFRED mentioned that at the local activity centre they are organizing a pool championship. This is something Otto really likes so he decides to have a look. Otto enjoyed the event and met some people that were interested in setting up a small pool club, so he added their contact details and they arranged to meet the next week at the activity centre. Sometimes Otto prefers to chat with his friends from home, and he has discovered that with ALFRED, he can have video calls that amuse him as he can see the person with whom he is speaking.
  • Pillars: Pillar 2, Pillar 1

UC - Effective and Personalized Care
  • Type  : Health Monitoring
  • Description  : Wearable sensors stream vital signs to a nurse, while the older adult controls data visibility and receives pill reminders and video check-ins.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff 
  • Personas: Otto the Older Person, Mike from the Medical Staff 
  • Scenario: For a couple of months now, Mike from the Medical Staff has been taking care of Otto the Older Person. Otto is an uncomplicated patient, who does not have any severe problems besides his blood pressure, which is a bit high. Mike regularly visits Otto to monitor his blood pressure. Twice a week, Mike calls Otto on the phone to ask him about his health status. However, there are times when Mike is not able to visit Otto as often as he needs to and consequently, he is sometimes concerned about Otto’s wellbeing. Therefore he talked to Otto about his concerns and they both agreed it would be a good idea to have the ALFRED device to be included in the care process in order to improve Otto’s healthcare and safety. The ALFRED solution seems a good option for enhancing the care process as its functions are expandable to the user’s needs. Furthermore, for this purpose Mike hands a new shirt to Otto, which contains a set of unobtrusive sensors. These sensors can send Otto’s vital parameters via ALFRED to Mike. This way, Mike is able to keep track of Otto’s health. Mike and Otto agreed that this solution would benefit both of them. However, Otto is also concerned about his privacy and feels that it is very important that he can decide which of the sensor data is available to Mike. He also wants to be able to check the vital data himself. Otto also wants the new shirt to look nice and fashionable and does not want it to make him look like a patient. Otto and Mike have also agreed that not all of the functions of the shirt have to be enabled at all times. However, Mike has informed Otto the health data that these sensors record can provide information about why he is feeling pain or stress. Mike and Otto agreed that it would be good if ALFRED could remind Otto to take his pills on a regular basis and Otto confirms to ALFRED once he has taken his pills. Furthermore, ALFRED should be able to collect and/or keep track of Otto’s heart rate, measure his body temperature, heart rate, breathing frequency, activity rate and the amount of taken steps. Mike is aware that Otto does not meet a lot of people, and so he wants to make sure that Otto is in a good shape and that he treats his health problems. Sometimes Mike calls Otto with the video call in order to check that he seems well.
  • Pillars: Pillar 3, Pillar 1, Pillar 4, General Requirements

UC - Games for Cognitive Stimulation and Staying Fit
  • Type  : Recovery & Rehab
  • Description  : Serious games keep the older adult mentally sharp and physically active, with performance summaries sent to medical staff for motivation.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff  
  • Personas: Otto the Older Person, Mike from the Medical Staff
  • Scenario: When Otto the Older Person feels bored, he asks ALFRED what to do and it might suggest a fun game. ALFRED offers a good selection of games that stimulate both the body and the mind. Otto knows that it is important to play these games on a regular basis, since Mike from the Medical Staff recommended doing so. Otto can also play together with a friend over the Internet, which Otto appreciates as it makes him feel less lonely. The mind stimulating games enable Otto to keep his brain active. Otto can sometimes be a bit impatient and this is why he does not like to play one game for too long. Luckily, ALFRED also proposes mind stimulating games that are short so that Otto does not have the time to become frustrated while doing his memory exercises. When Otto feels that he has not moved enough during the day, he plays games that make him perform mild physical activities. These games set specific goals for Otto, which motivate him to do all the proposed exercises. In the end, when he sees the results of the exercise (for instance, how many calories he has burned or which heart rate he had while playing), he is satisfied. Mike is very satisfied with the ALFRED games that Otto plays weekly, as he can observe Otto’s performance and easily check if his patient is feeling well. Mike is also able to coach Otto to perform better. Furthermore, Mike can directly ask Otto what is going wrong if he sees that Otto has not played for days or if he has very weak results. With Otto’s agreement, Mike can ask ALFRED to send a regular summary of Otto’s exercise sessions.

UC - Set Up by Older Person
  • Type  : Onboarding / Setup
  • Description  : An informal carer buys the ALFRED starter kit and, together with the older adult, installs core apps and browses the ALFREDO marketplace.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff (informal) 
  • Personas: Carl the Informal Carer, Olivia the Older Person
  • Scenario: Since Carl the Informal Carer was worried about his wife Olivia the Older Person, he has been looking for a solution that can both help Olivia to get better and also give Carl some more support in his care for her. He heard about ALFRED through a friend and he got interested as ALFRED is available on mobile devices, which makes it usable both indoors and outdoors. He bought two packages. Each package consists of a smartphone with the ALFRED app pre-installed, an Internet flat rate plan, and a simple step-by-step manual. Furthermore, Carl is satisfied as an after-sales service is provided in case he has trouble with the ALFRED device. Together, Carl and Olivia configure the ALFRED apps. Carl assigned the role of informal carer to himself. Additionally, they took a look at the easy-to-use ALFREDO marketplace for additional apps providing functionalities that are interesting for their specific situation. Based on their initial choices, ALFRED made more suggestions for other apps. Carl and Olivia are convinced that they are motivated to use ALFRED on a daily basis, as they can customize the ALFRED functionalities according to their preferences, which will enable them to use only the most useful and interesting services.

UC - Physical Impairment Rehabilitation
  • Type  : Recovery & Rehab
  • Description  : After a leg fracture, ALFRED guides the older adult through weekly rehab exercises, with video support and remote encouragement by a carer.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff (informal)  
  • Personas: Carl the Informal Carer, Olivia the Older Person
  • Scenario: Olivia the Older Person broke her leg few weeks back in a skiing accident and now she uses ALFRED to do her rehabilitation. ALFRED reminds her to start the exercises of the rehabilitation and tells her exactly what she has to do. When she asks for clarification, ALFRED shows her a video with an example. Olivia is motivated to use ALFRED for her rehabilitation as ALFRED sets different goals for each week, and after a few weeks of regular physical exercise with ALFRED, she can observe the results: her broken leg is getting back in shape. Sometimes Olivia plays a game over the Internet together with Carl the Informal Carer while Carl is away traveling for his job. This enables them to spend some time together, and also allows Carl to check that Olivia is doing well while he is away.
  • Pillars: Pillar 4, Pillar 1, Pillar 3

UC - Informal Care Coordination
  • Type  : Health Monitoring
  • Description  : Daily wellbeing check-ins, medication confirmations and contextual messages keep an informal carer informed without nagging the elder.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff (informal)  
  • Personas: Carl the Informal Carer, Olivia the Older Person
  • Scenario: Every morning ALFRED asks Olivia the Older Person how she is feeling. If ALFRED learns that Olivia does not feel well, it informs Carl about this. This is very useful for Carl who cannot be with his wife all the time even though she has health issues. ALFRED also indicates to Olivia when she has to take her medicine and Olivia confirms this to ALFRED as soon as she has taken it. Carl can check this by asking ALFRED if Olivia took her medicine. This way, Carl does not have to annoy Olivia by asking her, and he feels more at ease. Thanks to ALFRED, when Carl is not at home, communication between Carl and Olivia is now easier: they can send little messages with ALFRED. Because Carl is busy with work and taking care of Olivia, he uses ALFRED to remind him about things that he should do at home. During her days, Olivia enjoys cooking and with ALFRED she can even discover healthier recipes, as eating well is an essential part of wellbeing. In urgent situations, Olivia can ask ALFRED for help. ALFRED then checks on which of her carers are close by and calls them to check up on Olivia. This is also a great relief for Carl, who has been feeling much less stressed lately.
  • Pillars: Pillar 3, Pillar 1, Pillar 2

UC - Physical Impairment Care
  • Type  : Recovery & Rehab
  • Description  : A nurse prescribes themed exercise games for home-based rehab, while ALFRED tracks posture, variety and motivation cues for the patient.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff  
  • Personas: Mike from the Medical Staff, Olivia the Older Person
  • Scenario: After her skiing accident, Olivia the Older Person is released from hospital and has to start her rehabilitation process for her broken leg at home. Twice every week Mike from the Medical Staff comes to visit Olivia to check on the condition of her foot. Olivia discovered that she can use ALFRED in her care process and it can help her to get back in shape as ALFRED offers different kinds of serious games that train her muscles, movements, balance and endurance. Since Olivia has to perform physical exercises, she will need her hands free and have a big screen in order to execute ALFRED’s physical exercises in a safe manner. Mike has pre-selected a set of specific exercises from the ALFRED device in order to support Olivia’s care process. In order for Olivia to stay motivated, the games have to have something in common with her favourite sports, such as a “skiing-theme” or “winter-theme”. Furthermore, in order to avoid boredom and keep motivation high, ALFRED suggests different games, for example one day balance games, another day games for strength and the next day games to improve mobility. ALFRED will also remind Olivia to maintain a good body posture and will frequently give her tips on how to lead a healthy life. Since Olivia now spends a lot of time at home, ALFRED can provide her with some fun and creative games that she can play from her chair. She can also play together with a friend over the Internet, and together they can pass long moments playing. At any time, Olivia can also observe her game results and compare them to those of her friends.

UC - Adapted Interaction and Support for Daily Activities at Home
  • Type  : Daily Life Support
  • Description  : The elder customises voice speed, button size and spontaneous suggestion mode to make everyday tasks and home activities manageable.  
  • Groups: Older Adults  
  • Personas: Hilde the Older Person
  • Scenario: Hilde the Older Person received the completely installed ALFRED device from her daughter. She is not very used to new technology and she often needs help when using ALFRED. Luckily, ALFRED can provide her with instructions for usage and if she still requires assistance, ALFRED can automatically call her daughter. Hilde has customized the signal tones in ALFRED so that she can easily hear those. Particularly, the ALFRED vocal interaction voice speaks clearly and slowly enough, which enables Hilde to understand what ALFRED says. Furthermore, as Hilde has trouble seeing small written texts, she has adapted the font size of her ALFRED apps when she needs to read texts, which happens quite rarely. She likes that all the buttons in ALFRED are big enough to see and that she can manipulate them easily. She really likes the vocal interaction mode with ALFRED that she activates with a specific button, as this mode enables her to speak with ALFRED instead of reading and writing text that would take much more time. With the vocal interaction mode, Hilde can use the different ALFRED functionalities with her speech. For instance, ALFRED can ask her questions, such as would she like to go out and do something, if yes, ALFRED could propose outdoor activities in the neighbourhoods. These spontaneous questions with ALFRED amuse Hilde and give her new activity ideas. She turns off this ALFRED question mode, when she wishes to stay tranquil.
  • Pillars: Pillar 1, Pillar 2

UC - Support Activities on the Road
  • Type  : Daily Life Support
  • Description  : Mobile ALFRED offers fall detection, navigation, transit help and social event tips, boosting the elder’s confidence outside the home.  
  • Groups: Older Adults  
  • Personas: Hilde the Older Person
  • Scenario: When Hilde the Older Person goes outside she carries ALFRED with her. Because it is so small and easy to take with her, she never leaves it at home. ALFRED keeps her up to date on her voluntary work, which motivates her to participate more. She is also less afraid to go outside as ALFRED can detect any dangerous situation, such as a fall and notify her daughter. Also when she gets lost she can easily navigate by using ALFRED, hopping on the bus if she gets too tired to walk. This really increased her confidence to go out and move about. Hilde has given ALFRED permission to propose different activities in her town, and she is particularly interested in exhibitions and museums. At the same time, ALFRED gives her daughter more peace of mind as she receives a notification when Hilde strays away too far from home. She can then easily call Hilde, or she can locate her by checking her location with the help of ALFRED. Hilde is also reassured as she knows that ALFRED can call her a taxi if ever she gets lost and too tired to walk back home.

UC - Cognitive Impairment Rehabilitation
  • Type  : Recovery & Rehab
  • Description  : Serious games that mix creativity and mild physical movement are prescribed by a clinician to slow cognitive decline in the elder.  
  • Groups: Older Adults; Caregivers and Medical Staff 
  • Personas: Hilde the Older Person, Mike from the Medical staff
  • Scenario: Hilde the Older Person now spends a lot of time at home and due to her health and mobility restrictions, she has a lot less exposure to the outside world than she used to have some years ago. Apart from her physical limitations, Hilde’s daughter also realized that in the last couple of months, Hilde has been becoming more and more forgetful. She sometimes cannot remember names of friends anymore and has trouble in dealing with numbers. This conditions increasingly worried Hilde’s daughter. Together with Mike from the Medical Staff who already checks on Hilde’s cholesterol, they went to a medical centre to check on Hilde’s cognitive abilities. The tests confirmed that Hilde suffers from a mild cognitive impairment. A condition that does not require pharmacological treatment, but that can be potentially improved by having increased cognitive input. Mike uses the ALFRED device already with other persons who have trouble remembering things. Together, Hilde and Mike agreed to use ALFRED for playing some easy serious games to increase her cognitive workload and improve her mental capacity. For Hilde it is important that she can use her imagination and be creative in the ALFRED games. She also would like to see some of her personal interests and hobbies such as music and arts to be represented in the games. Hilde liked to be outdoors a lot when she was still healthy but now that she is more restricted to the house, she is keen to play games that take her outside. Mike also suggested that some small physical games between the cognitive sections will be good to improve her memory, especially movement that involves a cognitive component such as opposite arm and leg coordination. Both Mike and Hilde also like that the ALFRED games have scores that show if Hilde is improving when she plays the games. In the future, Hilde also wants to play together with a friend over the Internet, and together they can pass long moments playing.

UC - ALFREDO Marketplace
  • Type  : Marketplace Discovery
  • Description  : A developer studies APIs, compliance rules and the review pipeline, then uploads a sensor-reading app for distribution to ALFRED users.  
  • Groups: Developers and App Creators  
  • Personas: Dave the Developer
  • Scenario: Dave the Developer has convinced his manager to develop extensions for ALFRED, so he started developing an app that can read data from the health sensors a user is wearing. Dave starts his work by studying the API documentation and getting familiar with features ALFRED provides (e.g. components regarding speech recognition). He also has a look at the ALFREDO marketplace in order to check the terms and conditions regarding the sale of his applications. Dave steps through the API documentation and code samples in order to find out how he can define questions and actions the user can use to interact with ALFRED. He finds out that defining such questions is pretty simple and starts defining such parameters for his purpose. The ALFRED platform documentation also contains some rules an app developer has to follow in order to suit the ALFRED concept (concerning design and permissions the app will be granted). As soon as Dave has finished the development and testing of his app, he uploads it to the ALFRED marketplace in order to start the review process. As soon as the review process has been finished, Dave will be notified about the state of his app – whether it has passed the review or not. After Dave has created and uploaded his app and it has passed the review process, Olivia will be able to find it on the marketplace, install it onto her ALFRED device and check her health status whenever she wants to.
