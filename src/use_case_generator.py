You are a system requirements engineer.

Below is the summary of a system called ALFRED:

--- ALFRED SYSTEM SUMMARY ---
{system_summary}
-----------------------------

Your task is to generate a list of universal, persona-agnostic use cases for the ALFRED system. These use cases define key system functionalities across five categories:

1. Pillar 1 - User-Driven Interaction Assistant  
   (e.g., voice commands for daily tasks, reminders, basic queries)

2. Pillar 2 - Personalized Social Inclusion  
   (e.g., helping older adults connect with others, receive activity suggestions)

3. Pillar 3 - Effective & Personalized Care  
   (e.g., health monitoring, integration with wearables, caregiver alerts)

4. Pillar 4 - Physical & Cognitive Impairments Prevention  
   (e.g., serious games, exercise tracking, mental stimulation activities)

5. General Requirements  
   These refer to cross-cutting or system-wide capabilities that:
   - Are not specific to one pillar
   - Support the whole ALFRED platform
   - Often include privacy, security, installation, customization, accessibility, and system integration

Each use case must:
- Include a unique ID in the format "UC-001", "UC-002", etc.
- Include a **pillar** name from one of the 5 categories above.
- Include a short but clear **name**.
- Include a brief **description** (1‚Äì3 sentences) to explain the goal and function of the use case.

Output format (JSON array) is given as the below example:
[
  {{
    "id": "UC-001",
    "pillar": "Pillar 3 - Effective & Personalized Care",
    "name": "Remind Medication Intake",
    "description": "Enable ALFRED to issue voice-based reminders to users when it‚Äôs time to take their prescribed medications, and confirm whether they have taken them."
  }},
  ...
]

Only output a valid JSON array. Do not include any additional text or commentary. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response.

You are writing a lifelike usage scenario for the ALFRED system.

--- ALFRED SYSTEM SUMMARY ---
{alfred_summary}
-----------------------------

Below is an example scenario. It is only for the use case "Effective and Personalized Care". The example is provided to show the tone, structure, and depth expected in your writing. **Do not rely on its content**.

---
Personas: Otto the Older Person and Mike from the Medical Staff

Scenario: 
Mike from the Medical Staff has been caring for Otto, an older adult with mildly high blood pressure. To improve Otto‚Äôs care and provide peace of mind, they decide to use the ALFRED system along with a smart shirt that tracks vital signs like heart rate, temperature, breathing, and activity. This data is shared with Mike through ALFRED, while Otto stays in control of what‚Äôs shared and can view his own stats. He appreciates the privacy settings and wants the shirt to look stylish, not medical. ALFRED also reminds him to take his pills, and he confirms once he has. Occasionally, Mike checks in via video call, ensuring Otto is doing well, especially since he doesn‚Äôt have much social interaction. Together, ALFRED helps maintain Otto‚Äôs independence while supporting more effective and personalized care.
---

Now, please generate a scenario for a different use case and its involved personas:

Use Case:
ID: {use_case.id}
Pillar: {use_case.pillar}
Name: {use_case.name}
Description: {use_case.description}

Involved Personas:
{', '.join(persona_names)}

Write a grounded, practical, human-centered scenario showing how these individuals interact with ALFRED to fulfill this use case. Be realistic and detailed ‚Äî include motivations, interactions, day-to-day context, and outcomes.

Return only the scenario narrative. Do not include any additional text or commentary. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response.
