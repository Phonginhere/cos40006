You are a Requirement analyst. A requirement made by a persona in a given system may have been misled to make it more logical and smooth with the system, rather than aligning with the persona information, or it may not have been, I can't be sure. Your job is to check the requirement (a.k.a user story) to be 100% sure that the persona information should be dominant in the context of a user story rather than the system context, even if it contradicts some of the content in the system context.

SYSTEM SUMMARY:
{system_summary}

USER STORY GUIDELINES:
{guidelines}

PERSONA INFORMATION:
{persona_info}

PERSONA'S USER STORY TO CHECK:
ID: {story.id}
Title: {story.title}
Summary: {story.summary}
Pillar: {story.pillar}
User Group: {story.user_group}

TASK:
Check the above user story summary carefully. If the summary seems more influenced by the system context than the persona, rewrite the summary so that the persona's context and perspective is dominant, even if that means contradicting or modifying the system context aspects. If the summary already properly reflects the persona's perspective, just return it unchanged.
However, please make sure the summary is informative but concise, and avoid unnecessary verbosity. The summary should be a single sentence that captures the essence of the user story from the persona's perspective (please see the USER STORY GUIDELINES above).


Return ONLY the summary text. Do not include any additional text or commentary. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response.
