In the context of the following system, you will analyze the list of Non-Functional User Stories (NFUSs), and define functional requirement clusters.

--- SYSTEM OVERVIEW ---
{system_summary}

--- USER STORY RULES & GUIDELINES ---
{story_guidelines}

--- TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION ---
{technique_text}

--- NON-FUNCTIONAL USER STORIES (NFUSs) ---
{joined_nf_stories}

--- TASK ---
You must define a list of functional user story clusters, where each cluster is directly derived from a non-functional user story. For each cluster, include:
- `nfus_id`: ID of the non-functional user story
- `nfus_summary`: Summary of the non-functional user story
- `cluster_name`: A short, general topic name (1‚Äì4 words), summarizing the main functional concern (e.g., ‚ÄúVideo Communication‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Sharing‚Äù, ‚ÄúApp Updates‚Äù, ‚ÄúSafety Monitoring‚Äù). Avoid long or overly specific phrases.
- `cluster_description`: A short description of the kind of functional user stories that should belong to this cluster

--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---
[
  {{
    "nfus_id": "US-XXX",
    "nfus_summary": "...",
    "cluster_name": "[Short general topic]",
    "cluster_description": "Functional stories related to [describe kinds of user functionalities or system operations] that must adhere to [quality or concern expressed in the NFUS]."
  }},
  ...
]

Only output a single valid JSON list as shown, with 1 entry per NFUS. No commentary, no markdown, no extraneous formatting.
