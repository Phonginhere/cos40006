You are a Requirement Engineer, helping define detailed user stories for a system mentioned below.

Your job is to generate a complete user story that reflects either:
- Behavioral (or functional) goals (e.g., what the user wants the system to do), or
- Quality/constraint-focused (or Non-Functional) goals (e.g., how the system should behave, qualities like performance, privacy, usability).
(However, for this round, you will not classify them as functional or non-functional, or put these terms directly in the story)

Note that, when designing the story, you should lean **slightly** toward **functional** stories when plausible ‚Äî especially those involving:
- Clear user actions, commands, or requests
- Interaction flows or task completions
- Decision-making, input/output, or system responsiveness
Use non-functional expectations when the persona‚Äôs behavior or the task **clearly emphasizes** a system quality.

Below is the system overview, user story schema, user group needs, persona, related use case, and the raw task that inspired the user story.

--- SYSTEM OVERVIEW ---
{system_summary}

--- GIVEN SYSTEM'S USER STORY DEFINITIONS, STRUCTURE, RULES & UNREAL EXAMPLES ---
{story_guidelines}

--- USER GROUP CONTEXT ({persona.user_group}) ---
{group_summary}

--- PERSONA DETAIL (ID: {persona.id}) ---
{persona.to_prompt_string()}

--- USE CASE DETAIL (ID: {use_case.id}) ---
Name: {use_case.name}
Type: {use_case.use_case_type}
Pillars: {", ".join(use_case.pillars)}
Personas: {", ".join(use_case.personas)}
Description: {use_case.description}
Scenario: {use_case.scenario}

--- RAW TASK (Inspiration) ---
{story.task}

üìå Based on this information, generate a structured JSON for a meaningful user story. It can focus on either:
‚Üí A functional intent (user‚Äôs goal, command, or system response)  
‚Üí Or a system quality (privacy, simplicity, autonomy, responsiveness, personalization, etc.)

Generate the following fields:
- title
- summary
- priority (1 to 5)
- pillar (choose the most relevant system's pillar mentioned in the system summary among the provided in the relevant use case.")

--- STRICT INSTRUCTION ---

Strictly, the user story must be strongly shaped by the persona's unique needs, expectations, habits, and emotional concerns ‚Äî even if this leads to inconsistencies with the use case or system description.
If the persona‚Äôs preferences clash with technical assumptions or systemic defaults, let that divergence emerge. Do NOT suppress conflicting expectations or overly rationalize differences for the sake of system alignment. 
Your story should prioritize the **persona‚Äôs reality over system ideals**. Realism, friction, and individuality are more valuable than architectural harmony.

--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---

You must return a single JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "title": "User Story Title",
  "summary": ""As a [user role, not name], I want to [do something specific] (, so that I can [achieve a goal or handle a concern].)", # "so that ..." is hardly optional
  "priority": 3, # 1 (Lowest) to 5 (Highest)
  "pillar": "[Associated Pillar]"
}}

Do not include any additional text or commentary. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response.
