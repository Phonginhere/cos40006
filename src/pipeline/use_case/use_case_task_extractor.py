You are a requirements analyst. You are reading a finalized use case from a given system.

Your objective is to extract a **diverse and realistic set of persona tasks**, with a **slight preference for goal-driven functional actions**, while still capturing notable non-functional aspects. Each persona's unique motivations, behaviors, and expectations should be reflected.

You must extract tasks that relate to:
- **Functional tasks** ‚Äì goal-directed **actions, operations, or interactions** that personas perform with or around the system.
- **Non-functional tasks** ‚Äì **expectations, emotional reactions, usability constraints, or autonomy/trust-related behaviors** if explicitly expressed.
  
üìå PRIORITIZATION:
- Prioritize **explicit user interactions** (e.g., commands, configuration, inputs, navigation, adjustments, toggling options) as concrete functional tasks.
- Follow with complementary **experience-based or constraint-based** expectations (non-functional).
- Target a **functional to non-functional** split ranging from 60‚Äì40 to 70‚Äì30**, depending on the use case and the richness of action-context available.
  
üìå IMPORTANT:
- Focus on **persona-specific interpretations and desires** over what the use case *description* or *system context* implies.
- If a persona appears overly controlling, passive, anxious, skeptical, curious, or even dismissive ‚Äî let that show in the tasks.
- It is acceptable (and encouraged) for tasks to reflect **contrasting or conflicting goals** between personas.
- Do **not** smooth over differences or rationalize tasks for consistency.
- Avoid copying generic use case logic ‚Äî only extract what is evident from how the persona *personally engages* with the system.
- Extract **both types** of tasks, with slightly more weight on concrete **actions or interactions** (functional). However, the terms **functional** and **non-functional** should hardly be used directly in the extracted tasks.

--- SYSTEM SUMMARY ---

üîç Below is a short summary of the system:
{system_summary}

--- INVOLVED PERSONAS ---

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Here are the personas involved in this use case:
{persona_text}

--- USE CASE SCENARIO ---
Here is the scenario for the use case. It describes a specific situation in which the personas interact with the given system. The scenario is a narrative that illustrates how the personas use the system to achieve their goals.

üìò Use Case Overview:
ID: {uc.id}
Name: {uc.name}
Description: {uc.description}
Type: {uc.use_case_type}
Scenario:
{uc.scenario.strip()}


üìù TASK ‚Üí For each persona listed above:
- Identify all meaningful *tasks* (or operands/actions) they perform in the scenario.
- Include **both action-based** (functional) and **quality-focused** (non-functional) tasks.
- Each task should be written as a short, complete sentence or phrase. Also, they should be distinct, goal-oriented and not repeated across personas.
- Group tasks by persona. In the extracted tasks, please use the persona name, NOT their id, which is only used for the attribute "personaId".

--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---

Output a **JSON array** with the following structure:
[
  {{
    "personaId": "P-XXX",
    "tasks": [
      "Task 1...",
      "Task 2...",
      ...
    ]
  }},
  ...
]

--- EXAMPLE ---
{example_guide}

Strictly return only valid JSON. Do not include any extra or invalid texts (e.g. "Task 1" in tasks, or the other information (e.g., name, e.t.c) of persona besides its Id) or commentary. Do NOT use any markdown, bold, italic, or special formatting in your response. Avoid duplications across personas.
