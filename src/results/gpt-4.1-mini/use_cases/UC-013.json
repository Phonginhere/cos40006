  "description": "This use case describes the process by which older adults and their caregivers collaboratively configure the ALFRED system to match individual needs and privacy preferences. It ensures that users like Olivia and caregivers such as Mike and Sarah can tailor notifications, data sharing, and interaction modes for effective, secure, and user-friendly system adoption.",
  "scenario": "Olivia, a retired social worker with a deep-seated skepticism toward technology, reluctantly agreed to try ALFRED after her daughter’s insistence. From the start, she was clear: she wanted minimal fuss and absolute control over what data was shared. When Mike Johnson, the registered nurse assigned to her case, arrived for the initial setup, Olivia’s guarded demeanor was evident. She insisted that ALFRED operate strictly on her command, refusing unsolicited notifications and rejecting any video check-ins Mike suggested. Mike, used to busy hospital environments where efficiency and quick access to health data are paramount, found Olivia’s demands challenging. He preferred to block non-critical alerts during his shifts to stay focused but realized that Olivia’s preference for privacy meant he’d often have limited real-time data access.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Thompson, Olivia’s informal caregiver managing several clients, joined the setup via a video call. Sarah welcomed the chance to engage with Olivia through ALFRED’s social inclusion features and was keen on enabling interactive tools like games to build rapport. However, Olivia’s resistance to playful interactions and her insistence on formal, emotionless communication clashed with Sarah’s approach. Sarah tried to encourage more openness, suggesting ALFRED could help Olivia feel less isolated, but Olivia dismissed these ideas, concerned about privacy and overwhelmed by the system’s capabilities.\n\nDuring the configuration, Olivia carefully limited ALFRED’s data sharing permissions, allowing only essential health information to be accessible to Mike and Sarah, with strict prohibitions against third-party access. Mike respected these boundaries but worried this might impede timely interventions. Sarah, balancing multiple clients, found the manual logging preferences Olivia insisted on cumbersome but accepted them to maintain trust.\n\nDespite their conflicting styles—Mike’s clinical efficiency, Sarah’s nurturing multitasking, and Olivia’s guarded independence—the onboarding concluded with ALFRED tailored to Olivia’s exacting standards. Olivia felt a cautious ownership over the system, Mike adapted his expectations to respect her privacy, and Sarah planned to maintain gentle support without overwhelming Olivia. The tension between privacy, care efficiency, and social engagement remained palpable, yet all three recognized ALFRED’s potential as a flexible tool within their complex dynamic.",
