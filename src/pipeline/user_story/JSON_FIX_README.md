# JSON Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed JSON syntax error in `User_stories_for_P-004.json` in the `gpt-4o-mini` model directory:
   - Found a malformed field where `priority` and `summary` fields were incorrectly merged
   - Fixed by separating them into two distinct fields with proper JSON formatting
   - Line 165 had: `"priority": 2"As a medical sta"As a medical staff member,...`
   - Changed to: `"priority": 2,` and added `"summary": "As a medical staff member,...`

## Tools Created for Future Maintenance

1. Created `fix_json.py` script:
   - Automatically detects user story directories for all models
   - Identifies common JSON syntax errors
   - Automatically fixes missing commas
   - Creates backups before making any changes
   - Shows detailed context around errors for manual fixing

2. Added robust error handling to `UserStoryLoader`:
   - Improved error messages with line numbers and context
   - Graceful handling of JSON parse errors
   - Suggests running the fix script when errors are encountered

## Future Recommendations

1. Before running the pipeline, validate all JSON files with:
   ```
   python src/pipeline/user_story/validate_json.py
   ```

2. If errors are found, run the JSON fixer:
   ```
   python src/pipeline/user_story/fix_json.py
   ```

3. For complex errors that can't be automatically fixed:
   - Use the context information provided by the script
   - Check for missing commas, quotes, or brackets
   - Test fixes with `python -m json.tool <filename>`

4. Always make sure each field in the JSON is properly formatted:
   - Each field should have the proper syntax: `"field": value,`
   - String values need quotes: `"field": "string value",`
   - Numeric values don't need quotes: `"field": 2,`
   - The last field in an object shouldn't have a trailing comma
