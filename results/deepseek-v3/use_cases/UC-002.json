    "Description": "Elena and Thomas both take multiple medications daily but often forget the correct timing or dosage. ALFRED provides a simple voice or text interface to set up personalized medication reminders. When itâ€™s time to take medication, ALFRED sends a gentle reminder and confirms when the medication is taken. If a dose is missed, ALFRED alerts a designated caregiver or family member. The system ensures privacy by only sharing necessary information and allows users to adjust settings based on their comfort level."
