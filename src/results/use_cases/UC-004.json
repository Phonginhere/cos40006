ALFRED assists her by providing a simple interface to access the event, offering step-by-step guidance to help her connect with others. Olivia, who is already engaged, shares her experience and encourages Elena to join, fostering a sense of connection. Thomas participates in the event as well, enjoying the discussions while feeling supported without unnecessary oversight.
