UNREAL EXAMPLE — USE CASE TASK ANALYSIS INSTRUCTION
==============================================

EXAMPLE SCENARIO SUMMARY (from ALFRED project):
Personas: Mike from the Medical Staff (P-004), Otto the Older Person (P-002)

Scenario:
For a couple of months now, Mike from the Medical Staff has been taking care of Otto the Older Person. Otto is an uncomplicated patient, who does not have any severe problems besides his blood pressure, which is a bit high. Mike regularly visits Otto to monitor his blood pressure. Twice a week, Mike calls Otto on the phone to ask him about his health status. However, there are times when Mike is not able to visit Otto as often as he needs to and consequently, he is sometimes concerned about Otto’s wellbeing. Therefore he talked to Otto about his concerns and they both agreed it would be a good idea to have the ALFRED device to be included in the care process in order to improve Otto’s healthcare and safety. The ALFRED solution seems a good option for enhancing the care process as its functions are expandable to the user’s needs. Furthermore, for this purpose Mike hands a new shirt to Otto, which contains a set of unobtrusive sensors. These sensors can send Otto’s vital parameters via ALFRED to Mike. This way, Mike is able to keep track of Otto’s health. Mike and Otto agreed that this solution would benefit both of them. However, Otto is also concerned about his privacy and feels that it is very important that he can decide which of the sensor data is available to Mike. He also wants to be able to check the vital data himself. Otto also wants the new shirt to look nice and fashionable and does not want it to make him look like a patient. Otto and Mike have also agreed that not all of the functions of the shirt have to be enabled at all times. However, Mike has informed Otto the health data that these sensors record can provide information about why he is feeling pain or stress. Mike and Otto agreed that it would be good if ALFRED could remind Otto to take his pills on a regular basis and Otto confirms to ALFRED once he has taken his pills. Furthermore, ALFRED should be able to collect and/or keep track of Otto’s heart rate, measure his body temperature, heart rate, breathing frequency, activity rate and the amount of taken steps. Mike is aware that Otto does not meet a lot of people, and so he wants to make sure that Otto is in a good shape and that he treats his health problems. Sometimes Mike calls Otto with the video call in order to check that he seems well.
